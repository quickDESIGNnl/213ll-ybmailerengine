# GEM Mailer

GEM Mailer is a WordPress plugin that powers email notifications for new topics and other events. The main plugin file `gem-mailer.php` lives at the repository root and loads individual modules from the `modules/` directory.

## Logging

The plugin uses PHP's `error_log()` function for diagnostics. You can redirect these logs to a specific file by setting a custom error log path:

```php
ini_set('error_log', '/path/to/gem-mailer.log');
```

## Configuratie

From WordPress 6.0 and up the plugin adds a read-only settings help page under **Settings â†’ GEM Mailer**. The page lists every option key the modules rely on, including which JetEngine relation ID should be stored on each field (for example the relation between a Thema and its gebruikers). Use this overview to verify that the slugs in JetEngine Options Pages exactly match the expected option names.
